      <h2>My Journey</h2>
      <p>
        As a collage student that dream being on a volleyball team in TCGC, i work hard.. After a quick breakfast, heads to the gym for an intense workoutsession, focusing on strength and agility to improve my skills. I enjoy the rhythm of training, the sound of the ball bouncing off the court, and the feeling of my body becoming stronger with each session. Every moment spent refining her technique feels like a step closer to her goals. 
<br>
        At school, im an introvert or if i am in a mood i become a extrovert.My classmate admire my goal the way raw i balance my academic and the passion for volleyball. I believes that volleyball is more than just a sport; its a way to connect with others and build strong friendships. Whether on or off the court, .. values the bonds formed through teamwork and mutual respect.
<br>    
        In the afternoons, i join with other rokies for volleyball trainings.My coach is strict but supportive, pushing me and my rokies team to reach their full potential. I love the feeling of being part of a team, where everyone works together toward a common goal. I focuses on my spike, perfecting my timing and technique, while also practicing  passing and setting. The intensity of practice challenges me, but its also what drives me to keep improving.I  know that consistent effort is the key to success, and embraces every challenge that comes my way. 
<br>
        On a friendly game days together wtih the senior, my nerves are a mixture of excitement and determination. Before the match, my coach  gathers us (the rokies) for a pep talk, encouraging one another and reminding themselves of the hard work theyve put in. As thegame begins, my team is determination to win against our senior . The rush of adrenaline as  spikes the ball or makes a perfect pass is what makes the sport so exhilarating for me. 
<br>
        Even after the game ends, win or lose, I reflects on my performance. I will never settles for just being good enough; I always looks for ways to improve. On my way home, i mightlisten to motivational podcasts or watch game footage, analyzing our senior plays and thinking about how i can do better next time. Volleyball has taught me discipline,resilience, and the importance of perseverance. For me, the journey of being a volleyballplayer is a continuous cycle of growth, learning, and striving to be the best version ofherself both on and off the court.
